# C++ DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

This repository contains my personal implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. The goal is to practice and understand core concepts of computer science through hands-on coding exercises.

## Contents

The repo is organized into different sections based on data structures and algorithms:

- **Data Structures**: Common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.
- **Problems**: A collection of problems I've solved using C++ from different sources like competitive programming platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.)
